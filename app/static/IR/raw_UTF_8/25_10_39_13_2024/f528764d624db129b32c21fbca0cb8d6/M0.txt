b'MODULE M0\tNOTE ON BUSINESS AND TECHNICAL PROJECTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese modules are designed to help you produce a high quality eCommerce project.  \n\n\n\nThe twelve modules are written in the same style; that is a summary chart of action points followed by a page of notes on the following topics: - \n\n\n\n\n\nRationale\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\nAdvantages\n\n\n\nAction Points\n\n\n\nDos and Don\xe2\x80\x99ts\n\n\n\nThought Provoking Questions\n\n\n\nBest Resources for Help\n\n\n\n\n\nThe modules correspond to each of the 12 elements of the eCommerce Project shown in Chart M1.\n\n\n\nThe output of every project will be a business plan.  The project you choose may have a technical basis or a marketing basis because this is the way the course is structured.  \n\n\n\nHowever all projects must be integrated into a business process.  This is shown on Chart M2.\n\n\n\nModule 12 contains advice on the personal development programme to be carried out in parallel to the project.  If it is worth emphasising that all technical projects should contain a minimum of 20% of marketing and all marketing projects should have a minimum of 20% technical content.\n\n\n\nThe examples of business plans contained in Module 12 all contain the technical element. These plans have been drawn together from a variety of sources.  Please use them flexibly.\n\n\n\nWishing you every success.\n\n\n\nTHE COURSE TEAM \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nCHART M1\tPRODUCTION OF THE PROJECT, 12 MODULES\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.\tChoosing a Business Idea\n\n1.\tChoosing a Business Idea\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.\tDeveloping Your Personal Objectives\n\n2.\tDeveloping Your Personal Objectives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.\tWriting the Proposal\n\n3.\tWriting the Proposal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.\tSelecting Appropriate Research Methods \n\n4.\tSelecting Appropriate Research Methods \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.\tSystems Analysis/ Market\n\nOpportunity\n\n5.\tSystems Analysis/ Market\n\nOpportunity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.\tControlling the Project\n\n6.\tControlling the Project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.\tWriting the Business Plan and Implementing the Web-Based Solution\n\n7.\tWriting the Business Plan and Implementing the Web-Based Solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n8.\tMaking the Presentation\n\n8.\tMaking the Presentation\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n9.\tWriting the Reflective Management Report\n\n9.\tWriting the Reflective Management Report\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n10.\tAssessment Details \n\n10.\tAssessment Details \n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n11.\tPersonal Development \n\n11.\tPersonal Development \n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n12.\tExamples\n\n12.\tExamples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHART M2\tBUSINESS AND TECHNICAL PROJECTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.\n\nMARKET NEED\n\n\n\n\n\n1.\n\nMARKET NEED\n\n\n\n\n\n1.\n\nTECHNICAL\n\nIDEA\n\n\t\n\n1.\n\nTECHNICAL\n\nIDEA\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.\n\nBUSINESS VISION AND VALUES\n\n\t\n\n1.\n\nBUSINESS VISION AND VALUES\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.\n\nDO DESK RESEARCH\n\n\n\n\t\n\n2.\n\nDO DESK RESEARCH\n\n\n\n\t\n\n2.\n\nBUILD\n\nPROTOTYPE\n\n\n\n\t\n\n2.\n\nBUILD\n\nPROTOTYPE\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n2.\n\nBUSINESS OPPORTUNITY\n\nANALYSIS\n\n2.\n\nBUSINESS OPPORTUNITY\n\nANALYSIS\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n3.\n\nFIELD RESEARCH\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n3.\n\nFIELD RESEARCH\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n3.\n\nPILOT PRODUCTION\n\n3.\n\nPILOT PRODUCTION\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n3.\n\nBUSINESS PLAN\n\n\t\n\n3.\n\nBUSINESS PLAN\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n4.\n\nFULL SCALE PRODUCTION\n\n4.\n\nFULL SCALE PRODUCTION\n\n\t\n\n4.\n\nFULL SCALE LAUNCH\n\n4.\n\nFULL SCALE LAUNCH\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n    5.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION\n\n\t\n\n    5.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n1'
